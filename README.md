# Overview

## Route Finder

- Real-time pathfinding between two rooms done using an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm where each room is weighted equally (ie number of rooms)
- Includes a Map Viewer to visualize the route and how it flows
- Add custom times to your route for organized timing
- Used for fast iteration and timing of mock-up routes
- Easily copy and paste the route's rooms in a spreadsheet


## Segment Timer

- Can add or subtract segment times
- Provides results in seconds and HH:MM:SS.sss format
- Can copy the result easily by clicking the respective box


## Average Time

- Input a number of times (seconds format only) and finds the average between them all
- Does not account for the way Prime counts in-game time (1 frame = 0.01(6))
- Can copy result easily by clicking on it
