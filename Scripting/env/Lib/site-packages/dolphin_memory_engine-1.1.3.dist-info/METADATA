# Python Dolphin Memory Engine

A python library designed to read and write the emulated memory of [the Dolphin emulator](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) during runtime. 

Binary wheels are available on pypi for Python 3.8 to 3.12. Use `python -m pip install dolphin-memory-engine`.


## System requirements
Any x86_64 based system should work, however, Mac OS is _not_ supported. Additionally, 32-bit x86 based systems are unsupported since Dolphin dropped their support.

You need to have Dolphin running ***and*** _have the emulation started_ for this program to be useful. As such, the system must meet Dolphin's [system requirements](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin#system-requirements). Additionally, at least 250 MB of free memory is required.


If it doesn't work, verify that you do not have the `nosuid` mount flag on your `/etc/fstab` as it can cause this command to silently fail.

## Development Help

To compile the extension in debug:

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install Cython pytest
$ python setup.py build_ext -g --inplace --force
$ python -m pytest
